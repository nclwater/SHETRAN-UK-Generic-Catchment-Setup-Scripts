# SHETRAN-UK-Generic-Catchment-Setup-Scripts

This project contains the code required for setting up SHETRAN models for UK catchments. These are produced using ascii masks and csvs of soil and land cover parameters.

Simulations can be set up at a variety of resolutions using ascii masks.

Scripts included in this repository are:
- **Create SHETRAN Raster Data.ipynb:** Build the national scale input files that will be used to setup SHETRAN simulations. 

Simulations are set up from gridded historical climate data (CEH-GEAR and CHESS, 1980-2015) and static input data. 
These datasets are not included in this repository but code is included on how to build these. Code on how to build the soil map is not yet included, but will be in future iterations.
