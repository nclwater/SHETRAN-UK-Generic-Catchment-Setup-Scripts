Our aim is to make a raster map where each cell represents a subsurface column type (e.g. soil type + aquifer type, with depths), along with a csv file that contains the depths and parameters for each column type. This final raster map (.asc) and details table (.csv) will be made up of various spatial layers, typically a soil and a geology, with options for multiple soil layers, different geology types, and superficial deposits.\n",
