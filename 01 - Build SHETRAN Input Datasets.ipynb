    "The following code snippets will create the soil lookup maps for the UK, these detail the makeup of the subsurface. Our aim is to make a raster map where each cell represents a subsurface column type (e.g. soil type + aquifer type, with depths), along with a csv file that contains the depths and parameters for each column type. This final raster map (.asc) and details table (.csv) will be made up of various spatial layers, typically a soil and a geology, with options for multiple soil layers, different geology types, and superficial deposits.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data we use is typically split into a file that has the subsurface layer type and another that has the depth at the base of the layer. \n",

    "We will need to create some of these layers and do some reformatting before we use them.\n",

    "The later steps in this process will create a mask over the UK, and then sample the raster data layers above, then convert these lookup values into their actual soil types, parameters and depths, before finally restructuring these into a soil properties map and data table that we use to build the SHETRAN models. You will need to repeat this process to build setups at different resolutions.\n",
